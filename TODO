further improvement: 

1.

One good improvement would be to CACHE SOME SOAP REQUESTS for lets say 1
hour o so. 

2. 

Another discussion is wheather global_weather.yml config is needed or
not and where to place it ? This is very dependent on gem use. I created
a config/global_weather.yml in gems folder to help local gem
development. Just remember, options passed to GlobalWeather::Weather and
GlobalWeather::Country constructors override above mentioned config.

I will leave improvement for for version 0.0.2 :)
